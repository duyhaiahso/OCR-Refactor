# Implementation Planner

## Purpose

This planner turns the roadmap into an actionable implementation checklist.

The project should start with frontend and backend. The AI service can be integrated later through the API contract defined in `docs/06-api-contracts.md`.

## Current Strategy

Build order:

1. repository foundation
2. backend foundation
3. frontend shell
4. admin/dev permission flow
5. operational screens
6. Electron packaging
7. dongle integration
8. AI integration

## Current Status Snapshot

Last updated: 2026-06-23

Completed:

- Stage 1 repository foundation.
- Stage 2 backend foundation.
- Stage 3 database foundation.
- Part of Stage 4 frontend foundation.
- Stage 5 dev/admin management flow is mostly implemented for roles and users.
- Backend Swagger API documentation at `/api/docs`.
- User create/edit/delete/status management exists in frontend and backend.
- Shared confirmation modal exists for user update/delete/status changes.
- Role permission UI and backend protect `admin/dev` from normal admin users.
- i18n is wired for pages, modals, validation, notifications, and error/not-found screens.
- AppShell fixed chrome behavior is implemented so only page content scrolls.
- Product profile foundation is implemented with product code, model path, per-product camera config, per-product ROI regions, and template apply flow.
- Product profile ROI editor now supports direct drawing, move/resize/rotate, undo/redo, copy/paste, multi-select, assist overlays, and overlap validation.
- Product profile `batchSize` is persisted and can be updated from the operator runtime dashboard.
- Operator runtime dashboard foundation exists on `/dashboard` with product selector, ROI preview, API/demo product loading, and OK/NG/batch counters.
- Backend inspection foundation now includes Device Tool client wiring plus `/api/inspections/start`, `/api/inspections/current`, and `/api/inspections/:jobId/stop` with per-ROI inspection logs.
- Backend camera foundation proxies Device Tool status, device discovery, connect, grab, and live stream through `/api/camera/status`, `/api/camera/devices`, `/api/camera/connect`, `/api/camera/grab`, and `/api/camera/stream`.
- Backend license foundation checks the legacy `System8.dll` dongle flow, records `license_logs`, exposes public/authenticated license status endpoints, and blocks login when the dongle is missing unless dongle mock mode is enabled.
- Frontend login shows API/license/dongle startup status and disables sign-in until the backend reports a valid dongle.
- Dedicated Camera page exists at `/dashboard/camera` with product-profile selection, Device Tool status/device discovery, connect/grab/live controls, view adjustment persistence, and manual refresh for camera status/devices.
- AppShell warms up camera status/device discovery in the background for users with camera or inspection permissions.

In progress:

- Final responsive hardening for dashboard, roles, users, and products at the 1280x1080 factory-machine viewport.
- Role-based layout verification: `dev/admin` sidebar, `engineer/operator` navbar.
- Product module persisted save/load verification and Camera/ROI integration with product profiles.
- Dedicated Camera page verification with a real running Device Tool and connected hardware.
- Touch-first hardening for the single-screen factory touchscreen, including virtual-keyboard-friendly setup forms.
- Operator runtime foundation needs to be moved from demo-assisted UI behavior to the new inspection backend flow.
- Dedicated `roi`, `history`, and `reports` routes/screens are still missing behind existing menu permissions.

Not started:

- Dedicated ROI config screen/module.
- Dedicated history/reports screens and query flows.
- Electron shell.
- Full Electron boot-time dongle gate, periodic runtime recheck, and production hardware validation.
- AI integration.

Done when:

- `.exe` can run on target local machine
- app recovers from common startup failures
- role/permission behavior is verified
- release notes and deployment steps are documented

## First Implementation Target

The first real coding milestone is now mostly implemented:

```text
NestJS backend + PostgreSQL + auth + users + roles + permissions
```

Reason:

- permissions control the whole UI
- admin/dev flow is the highest priority
- frontend can be built correctly once the session payload is stable

## Next Implementation Target

The next practical milestone is:

```text
Responsive admin shell hardening -> Product + Camera verification -> Dedicated ROI/History/Reports screens -> Real runtime flow
```

Reason:

- the admin/dev foundation is in place
- product data is the base configuration for inspection runtime
- camera and ROI configuration depend on product/setup workflows

## Notes

- Do not wait for AI service before building FE/BE.
- Keep AI mocked until the real FastAPI service is ready.
- Keep the permission list flexible per role and per user.
- Keep all critical checks in backend.
- Keep Electron packaging in mind, but do not block early backend/frontend work on packaging.
